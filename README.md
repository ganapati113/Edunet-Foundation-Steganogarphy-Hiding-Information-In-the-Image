# Edunet Foundation - Steganography: Hiding Information in the Image 🖼️🔐

## 📌 Project Title
**Steganography - Hiding Information in the Image using Python**

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates the concept of **Steganography**, the art of concealing secret information within digital images. Developed as part of the **Edunet Foundation** initiative, this project uses Python to embed and extract hidden messages using the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** method. The goal is to show how data can be securely hidden in plain sight without altering the visual appearance of the image.

## 🎯 Objective
To implement a simple Python tool that hides and retrieves text inside image files, introducing learners to the fundamentals of data hiding and information security.

## 🧠 What is Steganography?
Steganography is a technique used to hide information within a non-secret file or message to avoid detection. In this project, the least significant bits of pixel values in an image are modified to encode a secret message.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- NumPy (optional)
- Tkinter (optional for GUI)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<ganapati113>/Edunet-Steganography.git
cd Edunet-Steganography
### 2. Clone the Repository
pip install -r requirements.txt
### 3. Hide a Message
python hide.py
### 4. Reveal a Message
python reveal.py

🔍 How It Works
✅ Encoding:
Convert secret message to binary.

Modify the least significant bit (LSB) of pixel RGB values to embed binary data.

Save the modified image.

🔓 Decoding:
Read LSBs from image pixels.

Convert binary back to text.

Output the hidden message.
