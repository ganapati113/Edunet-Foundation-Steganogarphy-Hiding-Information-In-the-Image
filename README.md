# Edunet-Foundation-Steganogarphy-Hiding-Information-In-the-Image
Steganography is the technique of hiding secret information within digital media like images. Edunet Foundation's project demonstrates how data can be embedded in an image without noticeable changes, using methods like LSB (Least Significant Bit). It helps learners explore secure communication and data protection techniques.
